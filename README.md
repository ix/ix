Hi there!

I'm just your average Haskell zealot.

This Github profile mostly serves as a dumping ground for various little projects I experiment with. Maybe you'll find something of interest buried within it?

I currently work with Haskell full-time, but some of my other loves are Ruby, Rust, Lisp and C++.
